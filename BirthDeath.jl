    module BirthDeath

Defines all critical functions and types for a simple birth death process. Exported
types are
    Parameter -> Collection of parameters
    PopulationState -> Current population state
    PopulationStatistic -> Population State to save for statistics
    ModelConfiguration -> essential model functions
Exported functions are
    Rates -> functions that return an array of rates for different events
    Execute ->  functions that execute the event (e.g. birth, death)

    ModelConfiguration(name::AbstractString; <keywords argument>)

Outer Constructor for the ModelConfiguration struc. Determines the rates and execute
Function from the name. Known model names are:
    Yule, Linear, Logistic, Immigration
Additionally a boolean keyword argument 'rescaled' can be handed in. If true the
`resc_execute` function is choosen, otherwise the `abs_executes`.
